/**
 * A trigger picker entry, loaded once (as a flat map) from {@code trigger_properties.json}.
 *
 * <p>{@code version}/{@code icon}/{@code kind} are optional, populated only for a schema-driven
 * trigger (transcribed from its {@code trigger-model.json}'s own top-level fields at onboarding time).
 * When present, {@link ServiceModelGeneratorService} builds the trigger's {@link TriggerBasicInfo}
 * directly from these scalars, without parsing/caching the connector's full (potentially large,
 * deeply-nested) {@code TriggerModel} just to populate the picker list. A legacy trigger (e.g. Solace,
 * which has no schema-driven model at all) simply omits them, falling back to the sqlite index derived
 * from {@code service_artifacts.json}.
 *
 * @param name         display name of the trigger
 * @param orgName      Ballerina organization name
 * @param packageName  Ballerina package name
 * @param keywords     search keywords for the trigger picker
 * @param triggerName  identifier used to locate the trigger model
 * @param version      package version (optional, schema-driven only)
 * @param icon         icon URI (optional, schema-driven only)
 * @param kind         trigger kind (optional, schema-driven only)
